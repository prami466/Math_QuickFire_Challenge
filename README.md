This Python script implements a simple arithmetic game called "Math Quickfire Challenge." The game generates a series of random arithmetic problems that the player must solve as quickly as possible.

Code Overview:

Constants:

    OPERATORS: List of possible operators (+, -, *).

MIN_OPERAND and MAX_OPERAND: Range for generating random operands.

TOTAL_PROBLEMS: Number of problems to be solved in the game.

Function generate_problem:

    Generates a random arithmetic problem with two operands and a random operator.
    Returns the problem as a string and its evaluated answer.

Main Game Loop:

    The player presses Enter to start the game.
    The game starts a timer and then iterates through TOTAL_PROBLEMS problems.
    For each problem, the player is prompted to provide an answer. If the answer is incorrect, the player is prompted again until the correct answer is given, incrementing the wrong counter for each wrong attempt.

End of Game:

    The total time taken to complete all problems is calculated and displayed along with the number of wrong attempts.
